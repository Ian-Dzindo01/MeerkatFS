API:
- Support range requests
- 302 redirect to volume server
- PUT DELETE key
- Blocks. 200 = written, other = nothing

# Start master server (default port 3000):
./master localhost:3001,localhost:3002, /tmp/cachedb/

Cache location ---> ./master/tmp/cachedb/

# Start volume server (default port 3001):
'''
./volume tmp/volume1/
PORT=3002 ./volume /tmp/volume2/
'''


The on disk cache is super simple. Nginx like with md5 for filenames
and the real name in the xattr.

# Usage:

curl -L -vvv -X PUT -d bandsonbands localhost:3000/wehave

curl localhost:3000/wehave

curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/wehave


To expect 50000 files by folder.
How do master servers find volume servers?
Going to have to support a STATUS and RANGE request.
